# Mapping Techinques

This all are the different Generative Adversarial Netwrok (GAN)-based architectures for mapping the Mel Cepstral Coefficients (MCCs)
of whispered speech to MCCs of Normal Speech.

The implemantation of these architecture have been done using both the libraries: Pytorch and Tensorflow.
