# Feature Extraction

We have used Male Cepstral Coefficient (MCC) features of wave file to train our Machine Learning Architectures. For feature
extraction, we have used AHOCODER.

For more about AHOCODER, you can refer [this link.](https://aholab.ehu.es/ahocoder/info.html)

We already have given all the versions of AHOCODER here. You need to run:

```
$ ./
```
