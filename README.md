# Whisper-to-Speech Conversion



## Objective
Big companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft are doing a remarkable job to improve the voice assistants. However, these Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) currently are facing the problem in recognizing whispered speech. This project solves this problem to some extent using ML-based algorithms.
